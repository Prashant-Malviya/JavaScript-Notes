// What is Synchronous And Asynchronous Programming ?

// Synchronous Programming means it will use a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time 

// Syn is blocking - it will only send the sever one request at a time and will wait for that request to be ansered by the sever 


// Asynchronous is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server at a time
